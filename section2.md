<h2><b>1.5 OPERATING SYSTEM CONCEPTS</b></h2>

<p align="justify">Most operating systems provide certain basic concepts and abstractions such as processes, address spaces, and files that are central to understanding them. In the following sections, we will look at some of these basic concepts ever so briefly, as an introduction. We will come back to each of them in great detail later in this book. To illustrate these concepts we will, from time to time, use examples, gener- ally drawn from UNIX. Similar examples typically exist in other systems as well, however, and we will study some of them later.

<b>1.5.1 Processes</b>

A key concept in all operating systems is the <b>process</b>. A process is basically a program in execution. Associated with each process is its <b>address space</b>, a list of memory locations from 0 to some maximum, which the process can read and write. The address space contains the executable program, the program’s data, and its stack. Also associated with each process is a set of resources, commonly including registers (including the program counter and stack pointer), a list of open files, out- standing alarms, lists of related processes, and all the other information needed to run the program. A process is fundamentally a container that holds all the infor- mation needed to run a program.
We will come back to the process concept in much more detail in Chap. 2. For the time being, the easiest way to get a good intuitive feel for a process is to think about a multiprogramming system. The user may have started a video editing pro- gram and instructed it to convert a one-hour video to a certain format (something that can take hours) and then gone off to surf the Web. Meanwhile, a background process that wakes up periodically to check for incoming email may have started running. Thus we have (at least) three active processes: the video editor, the Web browser, and the email receiver. Periodically, the operating system decides to stop running one process and start running another, perhaps because the first one has used up more than its share of CPU time in the past second or two.
When a process is suspended temporarily like this, it must later be restarted in exactly the same state it had when it was stopped. This means that all information about the process must be explicitly saved somewhere during the suspension. For example, the process may have several files open for reading at once. Associated with each of these files is a pointer giving the current position (i.e., the number of the byte or record to be read next). When a process is temporarily suspended, all these pointers must be saved so that a read call executed after the process is restart- ed will read the proper data. In many operating systems, all the information about each process, other than the contents of its own address space, is stored in an oper- ating system table called the <b>process table</b>, which is an array of structures, one for each process currently in existence.
Thus, a (suspended) process consists of its address space, usually called the <b>core image</b> (in honor of the magnetic core memories used in days of yore), and its process table entry, which contains the contents of its registers and many other items needed to restart the process later.
The key process-management system calls are those dealing with the creation and termination of processes. Consider a typical example. A process called the <b>command interpreter</b> or shell reads commands from a terminal. The user has just yped a command requesting that a program be compiled. The shell must now create a new process that will run the compiler. When that process has finished the compilation, it executes a system call to terminate itself.
If a process can create one or more other processes (referred to as <b>child processes</b>) and these processes in turn can create child processes, we quickly arrive at the process tree structure of Fig. 1-13. Related processes that are cooperating to get some job done often need to communicate with one another and synchronize their activities. This communication is called <b>interprocess communication</b>, and will be addressed in detail in Chap. 2.

![Figure 1-13]()

Other process system calls are available to request more memory (or release unused memory), wait for a child process to terminate, and overlay its program with a different one.
Occasionally, there is a need to convey information to a running process that is not sitting around waiting for this information. For example, a process that is com- municating with another process on a different computer does so by sending mes- sages to the remote process over a computer network. To guard against the possi- bility that a message or its reply is lost, the sender may request that its own operat- ing system notify it after a specified number of seconds, so that it can retransmit the message if no acknowledgement has been received yet. After setting this timer, the program may continue doing other work.
When the specified number of seconds has elapsed, the operating system sends an <b>alarm signal</b> to the process. The signal causes the process to temporarily sus- pend whatever it was doing, save its registers on the stack, and start running a spe- cial signal-handling procedure, for example, to retransmit a presumably lost mes- sage. When the signal handler is done, the running process is restarted in the state it was in just before the signal. Signals are the software analog of hardware inter- rupts and can be generated by a variety of causes in addition to timers expiring. Many traps detected by hardware, such as executing an illegal instruction or using an invalid address, are also converted into signals to the guilty process.
Each person authorized to use a system is assigned a <b>UID</b> (<b>User IDentification</b>) by the system administrator. Every process started has the UID of the person who started it. A child process has the same UID as its parent. Users can be mem- bers of groups, each of which has a <b>GID</b> (<b>Group IDentification</b>).
One UID, called the <b>superuser</b> (in UNIX), or <b>Administrator</b> (in Windows), has special power and may override many of the protection rules. In large in- stallations, only the system administrator knows the password needed to become superuser, but many of the ordinary users (especially students) devote considerable effort seeking flaws in the system that allow them to become superuser without the password.
We will study processes and interprocess communication in Chap. 2.

<b>1.5.2 Address Spaces</b>

Every computer has some main memory that it uses to hold executing pro- grams. In a very simple operating system, only one program at a time is in memo- ry. To run a second program, the first one has to be removed and the second one placed in memory.
More sophisticated operating systems allow multiple programs to be in memo- ry at the same time. To keep them from interfering with one another (and with the operating system), some kind of protection mechanism is needed. While this mech- anism has to be in the hardware, it is controlled by the operating system.
The above viewpoint is concerned with managing and protecting the com- puter’s main memory. A different, but equally important, memory-related issue is managing the address space of the processes. Normally, each process has some set of addresses it can use, typically running from 0 up to some maximum. In the sim- plest case, the maximum amount of address space a process has is less than the main memory. In this way, a process can fill up its address space and there will be enough room in main memory to hold it all.
However, on many computers addresses are 32 or 64 bits, giving an address space of 232 or 264 bytes, respectively. What happens if a process has more address space than the computer has main memory and the process wants to use it all? In the first computers, such a process was just out of luck. Nowadays, a technique cal- led virtual memory exists, as mentioned earlier, in which the operating system keeps part of the address space in main memory and part on disk and shuttles pieces back and forth between them as needed. In essence, the operating system creates the abstraction of an address space as the set of addresses a process may reference. The address space is decoupled from the machine’s physical memory and may be either larger or smaller than the physical memory. Management of ad- dress spaces and physical memory form an important part of what an operating system does, so all of Chap. 3 is devoted to this topic.

<b>1.5.3 Files</b>

Another key concept supported by virtually all operating systems is the file system. As noted before, a major function of the operating system is to hide the peculiarities of the disks and other I/O devices and present the programmer with a nice, clean abstract model of device-independent files. System calls are obviously needed to create files, remove files, read files, and write files. Before a file can be read, it must be located on the disk and opened, and after being read it should be closed, so calls are provided to do these things.
To provide a place to keep files, most PC operating systems have the concept of a <b>directory</b> as a way of grouping files together. A student, for example, might have one directory for each course he is taking (for the programs needed for that course), another directory for his electronic mail, and still another directory for his World Wide Web home page. System calls are then needed to create and remove directories. Calls are also provided to put an existing file in a directory and to re- move a file from a directory. Directory entries may be either files or other direc- tories. This model also gives rise to a hierarchy—the file system—as shown in Fig. 1-14.

![Figure 1-14]()

The process and file hierarchies both are organized as trees, but the similarity stops there. Process hierarchies usually are not very deep (more than three levels is unusual), whereas file hierarchies are commonly four, five, or even more levels deep. Process hierarchies are typically short-lived, generally minutes at most, whereas the directory hierarchy may exist for years. Ownership and protection also differ for processes and files. Typically, only a parent process may control or even access a child process, but mechanisms nearly always exist to allow files and direc- tories to be read by a wider group than just the owner.
Every file within the directory hierarchy can be specified by giving its <b>path name</b> from the top of the directory hierarchy, the <b>root directory</b>. Such absolute path names consist of the list of directories that must be traversed from the root di- rectory to get to the file, with slashes separating the components. In Fig. 1-14, the path for file CS101 is /Faculty/Prof.Brown/Courses/CS101. The leading slash indi- cates that the path is absolute, that is, starting at the root directory. As an aside, in Windows, the backslash (\) character is used as the separator instead of the slash (/) character (for historical reasons), so the file path given above would be written as \Faculty\Prof.Brown\Courses\CS101. Throughout this book we will generally use the UNIX convention for paths.
At every instant, each process has a current <b>working directory</b>, in which path names not beginning with a slash are looked for. For example, in Fig. 1-14, if /Faculty/Prof.Brown were the working directory, use of the path Courses/CS101 would yield the same file as the absolute path name given above. Processes can change their working directory by issuing a system call specifying the new work- ing directory.
Before a file can be read or written, it must be opened, at which time the per- missions are checked. If the access is permitted, the system returns a small integer called a <b>file descriptor</b> to use in subsequent operations. If the access is prohibited, an error code is returned.
Another important concept in UNIX is the mounted file system. Most desktop computers have one or more optical drives into which CD-ROMs, DVDs, and Blu- ray discs can be inserted. They almost always have USB ports, into which USB memory sticks (really, solid state disk drives) can be plugged, and some computers have floppy disks or external hard disks. To provide an elegant way to deal with these removable media UNIX allows the file system on the optical disc to be at- tached to the main tree. Consider the situation of Fig. 1-15(a). Before the mount call, the <b>root file system</b>, on the hard disk, and a second file system, on a CD- ROM, are separate and unrelated.
However, the file system on the CD-ROM cannot be used, because there is no way to specify path names on it. UNIX does not allow path names to be prefixed by a drive name or number; that would be precisely the kind of device dependence that operating systems ought to eliminate. Instead, the mount system call allows the file system on the CD-ROM to be attached to the root file system wherever the program wants it to be. In Fig. 1-15(b) the file system on the CD-ROM has been mounted on directory b, thus allowing access to files /b/x and /b/y. If directory b had contained any files they would not be accessible while the CD-ROM was mounted, since /b would refer to the root directory of the CD-ROM. (Not being able to access these files is not as serious as it at first seems: file systems are nearly always mounted on empty directories.) If a system contains multiple hard disks, they can all be mounted into a single tree as well.

![Figure 1-15]()

Another important concept in UNIX is the <b>special file</b>. Special files are pro- vided in order to make I/O devices look like files. That way, they can be read and written using the same system calls as are used for reading and writing files. Two kinds of special files exist: <b>block special files</b> and <b>character special files</b>. Block special files are used to model devices that consist of a collection of randomly ad- dressable blocks, such as disks. By opening a block special file and reading, say, block 4, a program can directly access the fourth block on the device, without regard to the structure of the file system contained on it. Similarly, character spe- cial files are used to model printers, modems, and other devices that accept or out- put a character stream. By convention, the special files are kept in the /dev direc- tory. For example, /dev/lp might be the printer (once called the line printer).
The last feature we will discuss in this overview relates to both processes and files: pipes. A <b>pipe</b> is a sort of pseudofile that can be used to connect two proc- esses, as shown in Fig. 1-16. If processes A and B wish to talk using a pipe, they must set it up in advance. When process A wants to send data to process B, it writes on the pipe as though it were an output file. In fact, the implementation of a pipe is very much like that of a file. Process B can read the data by reading from the pipe as though it were an input file. Thus, communication between processes in UNIX looks very much like ordinary file reads and writes. Stronger yet, the only way a process can discover that the output file it is writing on is not really a file, but a pipe, is by making a special system call. File systems are very important. We will have much more to say about them in Chap. 4 and also in Chaps. 10 and 11.

![figure 1-16]()

<b>1.5.4 Input/Output</b>

All computers have physical devices for acquiring input and producing output. After all, what good would a computer be if the users could not tell it what to do and could not get the results after it did the work requested? Many kinds of input and output devices exist, including keyboards, monitors, printers, and so on. It is up to the operating system to manage these devices.
Consequently, every operating system has an I/O subsystem for managing its I/O devices. Some of the I/O software is device independent, that is, applies to many or all I/O devices equally well. Other parts of it, such as device drivers, are specific to particular I/O devices. In Chap. 5 we will have a look at I/O software.

<b>1.5.5 Protection</b>

Computers contain large amounts of information that users often want to pro- tect and keep confidential. This information may include email, business plans, tax returns, and much more. It is up to the operating system to manage the system se- curity so that files, for example, are accessible only to authorized users.
As a simple example, just to get an idea of how security can work, consider UNIX. Files in UNIX are protected by assigning each one a 9-bit binary protec- tion code. The protection code consists of three 3-bit fields, one for the owner, one for other members of the owner’s group (users are divided into groups by the system administrator), and one for everyone else. Each field has a bit for read access, a bit for write access, and a bit for execute access. These 3 bits are known as the <b>rwx bits</b>. For example, the protection code rwxr-x--x means that the owner can read, write, or execute the file, other group members can read or execute (but not write) the file, and everyone else can execute (but not read or write) the file. For a directory, x indicates search permission. A dash means that the corresponding per- mission is absent.
In addition to file protection, there are many other security issues. Protecting the system from unwanted intruders, both human and nonhuman (e.g., viruses) is one of them. We will look at various security issues in Chap. 9.

<b>1.5.6 The Shell</b>

The operating system is the code that carries out the system calls. Editors, compilers, assemblers, linkers, utility programs, and command interpreters defi- nitely are not part of the operating system, even though they are important and use- ful. At the risk of confusing things somewhat, in this section we will look briefly at the UNIX command interpreter, the shell. Although it is not part of the operat- ing system, it makes heavy use of many operating system features and thus serves as a good example of how the system calls are used. It is also the main interface between a user sitting at his terminal and the operating system, unless the user is using a graphical user interface. Many shells exist, including sh, csh, ksh, and bash. All of them support the functionality described below, which derives from the orig- inal shell (sh).
When any user logs in, a shell is started up. The shell has the terminal as standard input and standard output. It starts out by typing the <b>prompt</b>, a character such as a dollar sign, which tells the user that the shell is waiting to accept a com- mand. If the user now types

date

for example, the shell creates a child process and runs the date program as the child. While the child process is running, the shell waits for it to terminate. When the child finishes, the shell types the prompt again and tries to read the next input line.
The user can specify that standard output be redirected to a file, for example,

date >file

Similarly, standard input can be redirected, as in

sort < file1 >file2

which invokes the sort program with input taken from file1 and output sent to file2. The output of one program can be used as the input for another program by
connecting them with a pipe. Thus

cat file1 file2 file3 | sort >/dev/lp

invokes the cat program to concatenate three files and send the output to sort to arrange all the lines in alphabetical order. The output of sort is redirected to the file /dev/lp, typically the printer.
If a user puts an ampersand after a command, the shell does not wait for it to complete. Instead it just gives a prompt immediately. Consequently,

cat file1 file2 file3 | sort >/dev/lp &

starts up the sort as a background job, allowing the user to continue working nor- mally while the sort is going on. The shell has a number of other interesting fea- tures, which we do not have space to discuss here. Most books on UNIX discuss the shell at some length (e.g., Kernighan and Pike, 1984; Quigley, 2004; Robbins, 2005).
Most personal computers these days use a GUI. In fact, the GUI is just a pro- gram running on top of the operating system, like a shell. In Linux systems, this fact is made obvious because the user has a choice of (at least) two GUIs: Gnome and KDE or none at all (using a terminal window on X11). In Windows, it is also possible to replace the standard GUI desktop (Windows Explorer) with a different program by changing some values in the registry, although few people do this.

<b>1.5.7 Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny</b>

After Charles Darwin’s book On the Origin of the Species was published, the German zoologist Ernst Haeckel stated that ‘‘ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.’’ By this he meant that the development of an embryo (ontogeny) repeats (i.e., reca- pitulates) the evolution of the species (phylogeny). In other words, after fertiliza- tion, a human egg goes through stages of being a fish, a pig, and so on before turn- ing into a human baby. Modern biologists regard this as a gross simplification, but it still has a kernel of truth in it.
Something vaguely analogous has happened in the computer industry. Each new species (mainframe, minicomputer, personal computer, handheld, embedded computer, smart card, etc.) seems to go through the development that its ancestors did, both in hardware and in software. We often forget that much of what happens in the computer business and a lot of other fields is technology driven. The reason the ancient Romans lacked cars is not that they liked walking so much. It is be- cause they did not know how to build cars. Personal computers exist not because millions of people have a centuries-old pent-up desire to own a computer, but be- cause it is now possible to manufacture them cheaply. We often forget how much technology affects our view of systems and it is worth reflecting on this point from time to time.
In particular, it frequently happens that a change in technology renders some idea obsolete and it quickly vanishes. However, another change in technology could revive it again. This is especially true when the change has to do with the relative performance of different parts of the system. For instance, when CPUs became much faster than memories, caches became important to speed up the ‘‘slow’’ memory. If new memory technology someday makes memories much faster than CPUs, caches will vanish. And if a new CPU technology makes them faster than memories again, caches will reappear. In biology, extinction is forever, but in computer science, it is sometimes only for a few years.
As a consequence of this impermanence, in this book we will from time to time look at ‘‘obsolete’’ concepts, that is, ideas that are not optimal with current technology. However, changes in the technology may bring back some of the so-called ‘‘obsolete concepts.’’ For this reason, it is important to understand why a concept is obsolete and what changes in the environment might bring it back again.
To make this point clearer, let us consider a simple example. Early computers had hardwired instruction sets. The instructions were executed directly by hard- ware and could not be changed. Then came microprogramming (first introduced on a large scale with the IBM 360), in which an underlying interpreter carried out the ‘‘hardware instructions’’ in software. Hardwired execution became obsolete. It was not flexible enough. Then RISC computers were invented, and micropro- gramming (i.e., interpreted execution) became obsolete because direct execution was faster. Now we are seeing the resurgence of interpretation in the form of Java applets that are sent over the Internet and interpreted upon arrival. Execution speed is not always crucial because network delays are so great that they tend to domi- nate. Thus the pendulum has already swung several cycles between direct execu- tion and interpretation and may yet swing again in the future.

<b>Large Memories</b>

Let us now examine some historical developments in hardware and how they have affected software repeatedly. The first mainframes had limited memory. A fully loaded IBM 7090 or 7094, which played king of the mountain from late 1959 until 1964, had just over 128 KB of memory. It was mostly programmed in assem- bly language and its operating system was written in assembly language to save precious memory.
As time went on, compilers for languages like FORTRAN and COBOL got good enough that assembly language was pronounced dead. But when the first commercial minicomputer (the PDP-1) was released, it had only 4096 18-bit words of memory, and assembly language made a surprise comeback. Eventually, mini- computers acquired more memory and high-level languages became prevalent on them.
When microcomputers hit in the early 1980s, the first ones had 4-KB memo- ries and assembly-language programming rose from the dead. Embedded com- puters often used the same CPU chips as the microcomputers (8080s, Z80s, and later 8086s) and were also programmed in assembler initially. Now their descen- dants, the personal computers, have lots of memory and are programmed in C, C++, Java, and other high-level languages. Smart cards are undergoing a similar development, although beyond a certain size, the smart cards often have a Java interpreter and execute Java programs interpretively, rather than having Java being compiled to the smart card’s machine language.

<b>Protection Hardware</b>

Early mainframes, like the IBM 7090/7094, had no protection hardware, so they just ran one program at a time. A buggy program could wipe out the operat- ing system and easily crash the machine. With the introduction of the IBM 360, a primitive form of hardware protection became available. These machines could then hold several programs in memory at the same time and let them take turns running (multiprogramming). Monoprogramming was declared obsolete.
At least until the first minicomputer showed up—without protection hard- ware—so multiprogramming was not possible. Although the PDP-1 and PDP-8 had no protection hardware, eventually the PDP-11 did, and this feature led to mul- tiprogramming and eventually to UNIX.
When the first microcomputers were built, they used the Intel 8080 CPU chip, which had no hardware protection, so we were back to monoprogramming—one program in memory at a time. It was not until the Intel 80286 chip that protection hardware was added and multiprogramming became possible. Until this day, many embedded systems have no protection hardware and run just a single program.
Now let us look at operating systems. The first mainframes initially had no protection hardware and no support for multiprogramming, so they ran simple op- erating systems that handled one manually loaded program at a time. Later they ac- quired the hardware and operating system support to handle multiple programs at once, and then full timesharing capabilities.
When minicomputers first appeared, they also had no protection hardware and ran one manually loaded program at a time, even though multiprogramming was well established in the mainframe world by then. Gradually, they acquired protec- tion hardware and the ability to run two or more programs at once. The first microcomputers were also capable of running only one program at a time, but later acquired the ability to multiprogram. Handheld computers and smart cards went the same route.
In all cases, the software development was dictated by technology. The first microcomputers, for example, had something like 4 KB of memory and no protec- tion hardware. High-level languages and multiprogramming were simply too much for such a tiny system to handle. As the microcomputers evolved into modern per- sonal computers, they acquired the necessary hardware and then the necessary soft- ware to handle more advanced features. It is likely that this development will con- tinue for years to come. Other fields may also have this wheel of reincarnation, but in the computer industry it seems to spin faster.

<b>Disks</b>

Early mainframes were largely magnetic-tape based. They would read in a pro- gram from tape, compile it, run it, and write the results back to another tape. There were no disks and no concept of a file system. That began to change when IBM introduced the first hard disk—the RAMAC (RAndoM ACcess) in 1956. It occu- pied about 4 square meters of floor space and could store 5 million 7-bit charac- ters, enough for one medium-resolution digital photo. But with an annual rental fee of $35,000, assembling enough of them to store the equivalent of a roll of film got pricey quite fast. But eventually prices came down and primitive file systems were developed.
Typical of these new developments was the CDC 6600, introduced in 1964 and for years by far the fastest computer in the world. Users could create so-called ‘‘permanent files’’ by giving them names and hoping that no other user had also decided that, say, ‘‘data’’ was a suitable name for a file. This was a single-level di- rectory. Eventually, mainframes developed complex hierarchical file systems, per- haps culminating in the MULTICS file system.
As minicomputers came into use, they eventually also had hard disks. The standard disk on the PDP-11 when it was introduced in 1970 was the RK05 disk, with a capacity of 2.5 MB, about half of the IBM RAMAC, but it was only about 40 cm in diameter and 5 cm high. But it, too, had a single-level directory initially. When microcomputers came out, CP/M was initially the dominant operating sys- tem, and it, too, supported just one directory on the (floppy) disk.

<b>Virtual Memory</b>

Virtual memory (discussed in Chap. 3) gives the ability to run programs larger than the machine’s physical memory by rapidly moving pieces back and forth be- tween RAM and disk. It underwent a similar development, first appearing on mainframes, then moving to the minis and the micros. Virtual memory also allow- ed having a program dynamically link in a library at run time instead of having it compiled in. MULTICS was the first system to allow this. Eventually, the idea propagated down the line and is now widely used on most UNIX and Windows systems.
In all these developments, we see ideas invented in one context and later thrown out when the context changes (assembly-language programming, monopro- gramming, single-level directories, etc.) only to reappear in a different context often a decade later. For this reason in this book we will sometimes look at ideas and algorithms that may seem dated on today’s gigabyte PCs, but which may soon come back on embedded computers and smart cards.</p>

<h2>1.6 SYSTEM CALLS</h2>

<p align="justify">We have seen that operating systems have two main functions: providing abstractions to user programs and managing the computer’s resources. For the most part, the interaction between user programs and the operating system deals with the former; for example, creating, writing, reading, and deleting files. The re- source-management part is largely transparent to the users and done automatically. Thus, the interface between user programs and the operating system is primarily about dealing with the abstractions. To really understand what operating systems do, we must examine this interface closely. The system calls available in the inter- face vary from one operating system to another (although the underlying concepts tend to be similar).
We are thus forced to make a choice between (1) vague generalities (‘‘operat- ing systems have system calls for reading files’’) and (2) some specific system (‘‘UNIX has a read system call with three parameters: one to specify the file, one to tell where the data are to be put, and one to tell how many bytes to read’’).
We have chosen the latter approach. It’s more work that way, but it gives more insight into what operating systems really do. Although this discussion specifically refers to POSIX (International Standard 9945-1), hence also to UNIX, System V, BSD, Linux, MINIX 3, and so on, most other modern operating systems have sys- tem calls that perform the same functions, even if the details differ. Since the actual mechanics of issuing a system call are highly machine dependent and often must be expressed in assembly code, a procedure library is provided to make it possible to make system calls from C programs and often from other languages as well.
It is useful to keep the following in mind. Any single-CPU computer can ex- ecute only one instruction at a time. If a process is running a user program in user mode and needs a system service, such as reading data from a file, it has to execute a trap instruction to transfer control to the operating system. The operating system then figures out what the calling process wants by inspecting the parameters. Then it carries out the system call and returns control to the instruction following the system call. In a sense, making a system call is like making a special kind of pro- cedure call, only system calls enter the kernel and procedure calls do not.
To make the system-call mechanism clearer, let us take a quick look at the read system call. As mentioned above, it has three parameters: the first one specifying the file, the second one pointing to the buffer, and the third one giving the number of bytes to read. Like nearly all system calls, it is invoked from C programs by cal- ling a library procedure with the same name as the system call: read. A call from a C program might look like this:

count = read(fd, buffer, nbytes);

The system call (and the library procedure) return the number of bytes actually read in count. This value is normally the same as nbytes, but may be smaller, if, for example, end-of-file is encountered while reading.
If the system call cannot be carried out owing to an invalid parameter or a disk error, count is set to −1, and the error number is put in a global variable, errno. Programs should always check the results of a system call to see if an error oc- curred.
System calls are performed in a series of steps. To make this concept clearer, let us examine the read call discussed above. In preparation for calling the read li- brary procedure, which actually makes the read system call, the calling program first pushes the parameters onto the stack, as shown in steps 1–3 in Fig. 1-17.
C and C++ compilers push the parameters onto the stack in reverse order for historical reasons (having to do with making the first parameter to printf, the for- mat string, appear on top of the stack). The first and third parameters are called by value, but the second parameter is passed by reference, meaning that the address of the buffer (indicated by &) is passed, not the contents of the buffer. Then comes the actual call to the library procedure (step 4). This instruction is the normal proce- dure-call instruction used to call all procedures.
The library procedure, possibly written in assembly language, typically puts the system-call number in a place where the operating system expects it, such as a register (step 5). Then it executes a TRAP instruction to switch from user mode to kernel mode and start execution at a fixed address within the kernel (step 6). The TRAP instruction is actually fairly similar to the procedure-call instruction in the sense that the instruction following it is taken from a distant location and the return address is saved on the stack for use later.

Nevertheless, the TRAP instruction also differs from the procedure-call instruc- tion in two fundamental ways. First, as a side effect, it switches into kernel mode. The procedure call instruction does not change the mode. Second, rather than giv- ing a relative or absolute address where the procedure is located, the TRAP instruc- tion cannot jump to an arbitrary address. Depending on the architecture, either it jumps to a single fixed location or there is an 8-bit field in the instruction giving the index into a table in memory containing jump addresses, or equivalent.
The kernel code that starts following the TRAP examines the system-call num- ber and then dispatches to the correct system-call handler, usually via a table of pointers to system-call handlers indexed on system-call number (step 7). At that point the system-call handler runs (step 8). Once it has completed its work, control may be returned to the user-space library procedure at the instruction following the TRAP instruction (step 9). This procedure then returns to the user program in the usual way procedure calls return (step 10).
To finish the job, the user program has to clean up the stack, as it does after any procedure call (step 11). Assuming the stack grows downward, as it often

does, the compiled code increments the stack pointer exactly enough to remove the parameters pushed before the call to read. The program is now free to do whatever it wants to do next.
In step 9 above, we said ‘‘may be returned to the user-space library procedure’’ for good reason. The system call may block the caller, preventing it from continu- ing. For example, if it is trying to read from the keyboard and nothing has been typed yet, the caller has to be blocked. In this case, the operating system will look around to see if some other process can be run next. Later, when the desired input is available, this process will get the attention of the system and run steps 9–11.
In the following sections, we will examine some of the most heavily used POSIX system calls, or more specifically, the library procedures that make those system calls. POSIX has about 100 procedure calls. Some of the most important ones are listed in Fig. 1-18, grouped for convenience in four categories. In the text we will briefly examine each call to see what it does.
To a large extent, the services offered by these calls determine most of what the operating system has to do, since the resource management on personal com- puters is minimal (at least compared to big machines with multiple users). The services include things like creating and terminating processes, creating, deleting, reading, and writing files, managing directories, and performing input and output.
As an aside, it is worth pointing out that the mapping of POSIX procedure calls onto system calls is not one-to-one. The POSIX standard specifies a number of procedures that a conformant system must supply, but it does not specify wheth- er they are system calls, library calls, or something else. If a procedure can be car- ried out without invoking a system call (i.e., without trapping to the kernel), it will usually be done in user space for reasons of performance. However, most of the POSIX procedures do invoke system calls, usually with one procedure mapping di- rectly onto one system call. In a few cases, especially where several required pro- cedures are only minor variations of one another, one system call handles more than one library call.

<b>1.6.1 System Calls for Process Management</b>

The first group of calls in Fig. 1-18 deals with process management. Fork is a good place to start the discussion. Fork is the only way to create a new process in POSIX. It creates an exact duplicate of the original process, including all the file descriptors, registers—everything. After the fork, the original process and the copy (the parent and child) go their separate ways. All the variables have identical val- ues at the time of the fork, but since the parent’s data are copied to create the child, subsequent changes in one of them do not affect the other one. (The program text, which is unchangeable, is shared between parent and child.) The fork call returns a value, which is zero in the child and equal to the child’s <b>PID</b> (<b>Process IDentifier</b>) in the parent. Using the returned PID, the two processes can see which one is the parent process and which one is the child process.

![Figure 1-18]()

In most cases, after a fork, the child will need to execute different code from the parent. Consider the case of the shell. It reads a command from the terminal, forks off a child process, waits for the child to execute the command, and then reads the next command when the child terminates. To wait for the child to finish, the parent executes a waitpid system call, which just waits until the child terminates (any child if more than one exists). Waitpid can wait for a specific child, or for any old child by setting the first parameter to −1. When waitpid completes, the address pointed to by the second parameter, statloc, will be set to the child process’ exit status (normal or abnormal termination and exit value). Various options are also provided, specified by the third parameter. For example, returning immediately if no child has already exited.
Now consider how fork is used by the shell. When a command is typed, the shell forks off a new process. This child process must execute the user command. It does this by using the execve system call, which causes its entire core image to be replaced by the file named in its first parameter. (Actually, the system call itself is exec, but several library procedures call it with different parameters and slightly different names. We will treat these as system calls here.) A highly simplified shell illustrating the use of fork, waitpid, and execve is shown in Fig. 1-19.

![figure 1-19]()

In the most general case, execve has three parameters: the name of the file to be executed, a pointer to the argument array, and a pointer to the environment array. These will be described shortly. Various library routines, including execl, execv, execle, and execve, are provided to allow the parameters to be omitted or specified in various ways. Throughout this book we will use the name exec to represent the system call invoked by all of these.
Let us consider the case of a command such as 

cp file 1 file2

used to copy file1 to file2. After the shell has forked, the child process locates and executes the file cp and passes to it the names of the source and target files. The main program of cp (and main program of most other C programs) contains the declaration

main(argc, argv, envp)

where argc is a count of the number of items on the command line, including the program name. For the example above, argc is 3.
The second parameter, argv, is a pointer to an array. Element i of that array is a pointer to the ith string on the command line. In our example, argv[0] would point to the string ‘‘cp’’, argv[1] would point to the string ‘‘file1’’, and argv[2] would point to the string ‘‘file2’’.
The third parameter of main, envp, is a pointer to the environment, an array of strings containing assignments of the form name = value used to pass information such as the terminal type and home directory name to programs. There are library procedures that programs can call to get the environment variables, which are often used to customize how a user wants to perform certain tasks (e.g., the default print- er to use). In Fig. 1-19, no environment is passed to the child, so the third parame- ter of execve is a zero.
If exec seems complicated, do not despair; it is (semantically) the most com- plex of all the POSIX system calls. All the other ones are much simpler. As an ex- ample of a simple one, consider exit, which processes should use when they are finished executing. It has one parameter, the exit status (0 to 255), which is re- turned to the parent via statloc in the waitpid system call.
Processes in UNIX have their memory divided up into three segments: the <b>text segment</b> (i.e., the program code), the <b>data segment</b> (i.e., the variables), and the <b>stack segment</b>. The data segment grows upward and the stack grows downward, as shown in Fig. 1-20. Between them is a gap of unused address space. The stack grows into the gap automatically, as needed, but expansion of the data segment is done explicitly by using a system call, brk, which specifies the new address where the data segment is to end. This call, however, is not defined by the POSIX standard, since programmers are encouraged to use the malloc library procedure for dynamically allocating storage, and the underlying implementation of malloc was not thought to be a suitable subject for standardization since few programmers use it directly and it is doubtful that anyone even notices that brk is not in POSIX.

<b>1.6.2 System Calls for File Management</b>

Many system calls relate to the file system. In this section we will look at calls that operate on individual files; in the next one we will examine those that involve directories or the file system as a whole.
To read or write a file, it must first be opened. This call specifies the file name to be opened, either as an absolute path name or relative to the working directory, as well as a code of O RDONLY, O WRONLY, or O RDWR, meaning open for reading, writing, or both. To create a new file, the O CREAT parameter is used.

![figure 1-20]()

The file descriptor returned can then be used for reading or writing. Afterward, the file can be closed by close, which makes the file descriptor available for reuse on a subsequent open.
The most heavily used calls are undoubtedly read and write. We saw read ear- lier. Write has the same parameters.
Although most programs read and write files sequentially, for some applica- tions programs need to be able to access any part of a file at random. Associated with each file is a pointer that indicates the current position in the file. When read- ing (writing) sequentially, it normally points to the next byte to be read (written). The lseek call changes the value of the position pointer, so that subsequent calls to read or write can begin anywhere in the file.
Lseek has three parameters: the first is the file descriptor for the file, the sec- ond is a file position, and the third tells whether the file position is relative to the beginning of the file, the current position, or the end of the file. The value returned by lseek is the absolute position in the file (in bytes) after changing the pointer.
For each file, UNIX keeps track of the file mode (regular file, special file, di- rectory, and so on), size, time of last modification, and other information. Pro- grams can ask to see this information via the stat system call. The first parameter specifies the file to be inspected; the second one is a pointer to a structure where the information is to be put. The fstat calls does the same thing for an open file.

<b>1.6.3 System Calls for Directory Management</b>

In this section we will look at some system calls that relate more to directories or the file system as a whole, rather than just to one specific file as in the previous section. The first two calls, mkdir and rmdir, create and remove empty directories, respectively. The next call is link. Its purpose is to allow the same file to appear under two or more names, often in different directories. A typical use is to allow several members of the same programming team to share a common file, with each of them having the file appear in his own directory, possibly under different names. Sharing a file is not the same as giving every team member a private copy; having a shared file means that changes that any member of the team makes are instantly visible to the other members—there is only one file. When copies are made of a file, subsequent changes made to one copy do not affect the others.
To see how link works, consider the situation of Fig. 1-21(a). Here are two users, ast and jim, each having his own directory with some files. If ast now ex- ecutes a program containing the system call

link('/user/jim/memo","/usr/ast/note");

the file memo in jim’s directory is now entered into ast’s directory under the name note. Thereafter, /usr/jim/memo and /usr/ast/note refer to the same file. As an aside, whether user directories are kept in /usr, /user, /home, or somewhere else is simply a decision made by the local system administrator.

![figure 1-12]()

Understanding how link works will probably make it clearer what it does. Every file in UNIX has a unique number, its i-number, that identifies it. This i-number is an index into a table of <b>i-nodes</b>, one per file, telling who owns the file, where its disk blocks are, and so on. A directory is simply a file containing a set of (i-number, ASCII name) pairs. In the first versions of UNIX, each directory entry was 16 bytes—2 bytes for the i-number and 14 bytes for the name. Now a more complicated structure is needed to support long file names, but conceptually a di- rectory is still a set of (i-number, ASCII name) pairs. In Fig. 1-21, mail has i-num- ber 16, and so on. What link does is simply create a brand new directory entry with a (possibly new) name, using the i-number of an existing file. In Fig. 1-21(b), two entries have the same i-number (70) and thus refer to the same file. If either one is later removed, using the unlink system call, the other one remains. If both are re- moved, UNIX sees that no entries to the file exist (a field in the i-node keeps track of the number of directory entries pointing to the file), so the file is removed from the disk.
As we have mentioned earlier, the mount system call allows two file systems to be merged into one. A common situation is to have the root file system, containing the binary (executable) versions of the common commands and other heavily used files, on a hard disk (sub)partition and user files on another (sub)partition. Further, the user can then insert a USB disk with files to be read.
By executing the mount system call, the USB file system can be attached to the
root file system, as shown in Fig. 1-22. A typical statement in C to mount is

mount("/dev/sdb0", "/mnt", 0);

where the first parameter is the name of a block special file for USB drive 0, the second parameter is the place in the tree where it is to be mounted, and the third parameter tells whether the file system is to be mounted read-write or read-only.

![figure 1-22]()

After the mount call, a file on drive 0 can be accessed by just using its path from the root directory or the working directory, without regard to which drive it is on. In fact, second, third, and fourth drives can also be mounted anywhere in the tree. The mount call makes it possible to integrate removable media into a single integrated file hierarchy, without having to worry about which device a file is on. Although this example involves CD-ROMs, portions of hard disks (often called <b>partitions</b> or <b>minor devices</b>) can also be mounted this way, as well as external hard disks and USB sticks. When a file system is no longer needed, it can be unmounted with the umount system call.

<b>1.6.4 Miscellaneous System Calls</b>

A variety of other system calls exist as well. We will look at just four of them here. The chdir call changes the current working directory. After the call

chdir("/usr/ast/test");

an open on the file xyz will open /usr/ast/test/xyz. The concept of a working direc- tory eliminates the need for typing (long) absolute path names all the time.
In UNIX every file has a mode used for protection. The mode includes the read-write-execute bits for the owner, group, and others. The chmod system call makes it possible to change the mode of a file. For example, to make a file read- only by everyone except the owner, one could execute

chmod("file", 0644);

The kill system call is the way users and user processes send signals. If a proc- ess is prepared to catch a particular signal, then when it arrives, a signal handler is run. If the process is not prepared to handle a signal, then its arrival kills the proc- ess (hence the name of the call).
POSIX defines a number of procedures for dealing with time. For example, time just returns the current time in seconds, with 0 corresponding to Jan. 1, 1970 at midnight (just as the day was starting, not ending). On computers using 32-bit words, the maximum value time can return is 232 − 1 seconds (assuming an unsign- ed integer is used). This value corresponds to a little over 136 years. Thus in the year 2106, 32-bit UNIX systems will go berserk, not unlike the famous Y2K prob- lem that would have wreaked havoc with the world’s computers in 2000, were it not for the massive effort the IT industry put into fixing the problem. If you cur- rently have a 32-bit UNIX system, you are advised to trade it in for a 64-bit one sometime before the year 2106.

<b>1.6.5 The Windows Win32 API</b>

So far we have focused primarily on UNIX. Now it is time to look briefly at Windows. Windows and UNIX differ in a fundamental way in their respective pro- gramming models. A UNIX program consists of code that does something or other, making system calls to have certain services performed. In contrast, a Win- dows program is normally event driven. The main program waits for some event to happen, then calls a procedure to handle it. Typical events are keys being struck, the mouse being moved, a mouse button being pushed, or a USB drive inserted. Handlers are then called to process the event, update the screen and update the in- ternal program state. All in all, this leads to a somewhat different style of pro- gramming than with UNIX, but since the focus of this book is on operating system function and structure, these different programming models will not concern us much more.
Of course, Windows also has system calls. With UNIX, there is almost a one- to-one relationship between the system calls (e.g., read) and the library procedures (e.g., read) used to invoke the system calls. In other words, for each system call, there is roughly one library procedure that is called to invoke it, as indicated in Fig. 1-17. Furthermore, POSIX has only about 100 procedure calls.
With Windows, the situation is radically different. To start with, the library calls and the actual system calls are highly decoupled. Microsoft has defined a set of procedures called the <b>Win32 API</b> (<b>Application Programming Interface</b>) that programmers are expected to use to get operating system services. This interface is (partially) supported on all versions of Windows since Windows 95. By decou- pling the API interface from the actual system calls, Microsoft retains the ability to change the actual system calls in time (even from release to release) without invali- dating existing programs. What actually constitutes Win32 is also slightly ambigu- ous because recent versions of Windows have many new calls that were not previ- ously available. In this section, Win32 means the interface supported by all ver- sions of Windows. Win32 provides compatibility among versions of Windows.
The number of Win32 API calls is extremely large, numbering in the thou- sands. Furthermore, while many of them do invoke system calls, a substantial num- ber are carried out entirely in user space. As a consequence, with Windows it is impossible to see what is a system call (i.e., performed by the kernel) and what is simply a user-space library call. In fact, what is a system call in one version of Windows may be done in user space in a different version, and vice versa. When we discuss the Windows system calls in this book, we will use the Win32 proce- dures (where appropriate) since Microsoft guarantees that these will be stable over time. But it is worth remembering that not all of them are true system calls (i.e., traps to the kernel).
The Win32 API has a huge number of calls for managing windows, geometric figures, text, fonts, scrollbars, dialog boxes, menus, and other features of the GUI. To the extent that the graphics subsystem runs in the kernel (true on some versions of Windows but not on all), these are system calls; otherwise they are just library calls. Should we discuss these calls in this book or not? Since they are not really related to the function of an operating system, we have decided not to, even though they may be carried out by the kernel. Readers interested in the Win32 API should consult one of the many books on the subject (e.g., Hart, 1997; Rector and New- comer, 1997; and Simon, 1997).
Even introducing all the Win32 API calls here is out of the question, so we will restrict ourselves to those calls that roughly correspond to the functionality of the UNIX calls listed in Fig. 1-18. These are listed in Fig. 1-23.
Let us now briefly go through the list of Fig. 1-23. CreateProcess creates a new process. It does the combined work of fork and execve in UNIX. It has many parameters specifying the properties of the newly created process. Windows does not have a process hierarchy as UNIX does so there is no concept of a parent proc- ess and a child process. After a process is created, the creator and createe are equals. WaitForSingleObject is used to wait for an event. Many possible events can be waited for. If the parameter specifies a process, then the caller waits for the specified process to exit, which is done using ExitProcess.
The next six calls operate on files and are functionally similar to their UNIX counterparts although they differ in the parameters and details. Still, files can be opened, closed, read, and written pretty much as in UNIX. The SetFilePointer and GetFileAttributesEx calls set the file position and get some of the file attributes.
Windows has directories and they are created with CreateDirector y and RemoveDirector y A P I calls, respectively. There is also a notion of a current direc- tory, set by SetCurrentDirector y. The current time of day is acquired using GetLo- calTime.
The Win32 interface does not have links to files, mounted file systems, securi- ty, or signals, so the calls corresponding to the UNIX ones do not exist. Of course, Win32 has a huge number of other calls that UNIX does not have, especially for managing the GUI. Windows Vista has an elaborate security system and also sup- ports file links. Windows 7 and 8 add yet more features and system calls.

![figure 1-23]()

One last note about Win32 is perhaps worth making. Win32 is not a terribly uniform or consistent interface. The main culprit here was the need to be back- ward compatible with the previous 16-bit interface used in Windows 3.x.

<h2>1.7 OPERATING SYSTEM STRUCTURE</h2>
Now that we have seen what operating systems look like on the outside (i.e., the programmer’s interface), it is time to take a look inside. In the following sec- tions, we will examine six different structures that have been tried, in order to get some idea of the spectrum of possibilities. These are by no means exhaustive, but they give an idea of some designs that have been tried in practice. The six designs we will discuss here are monolithic systems, layered systems, microkernels, cli- ent-server systems, virtual machines, and exokernels.

<b>1.7.1 Monolithic Systems</b>

By far the most common organization, in the monolithic approach the entire operating system runs as a single program in kernel mode. The operating system is written as a collection of procedures, linked together into a single large executable binary program. When this technique is used, each procedure in the system is free to call any other one, if the latter provides some useful computation that the former needs. Being able to call any procedure you want is very efficient, but having thou- sands of procedures that can call each other without restriction may also lead to a system that is unwieldy and difficult to understand. Also, a crash in any of these procedures will take down the entire operating system.
To construct the actual object program of the operating system when this ap- proach is used, one first compiles all the individual procedures (or the files con- taining the procedures) and then binds them all together into a single executable file using the system linker. In terms of information hiding, there is essentially none—every procedure is visible to every other procedure (as opposed to a struc- ture containing modules or packages, in which much of the information is hidden away inside modules, and only the officially designated entry points can be called from outside the module).
Even in monolithic systems, however, it is possible to have some structure. The services (system calls) provided by the operating system are requested by putting the parameters in a well-defined place (e.g., on the stack) and then executing a trap instruction. This instruction switches the machine from user mode to kernel mode and transfers control to the operating system, shown as step 6 in Fig. 1-17. The operating system then fetches the parameters and determines which system call is to be carried out. After that, it indexes into a table that contains in slot k a pointer to the procedure that carries out system call k (step 7 in Fig. 1-17).
This organization suggests a basic structure for the operating system:

1. A main program that invokes the requested service procedure.
   
2. A set of service procedures that carry out the system calls.
   
3. A set of utility procedures that help the service procedures.
   
In this model, for each system call there is one service procedure that takes care of it and executes it. The utility procedures do things that are needed by several ser- vice procedures, such as fetching data from user programs. This division of the procedures into three layers is shown in Fig. 1-24.
In addition to the core operating system that is loaded when the computer is booted, many operating systems support loadable extensions, such as I/O device drivers and file systems. These components are loaded on demand. In UNIX they are called <b>shared libraries</b>. In Windows they are called <b>DLLs</b> (<b>Dynamic-Link Libraries</b>). They have file extension .dll and the C:\Windows\system32 directory on Windows systems has well over 1000 of them.

![figure 1-24]()

<b>1.7.2 Layered Systems</b>

A generalization of the approach of Fig. 1-24 is to organize the operating sys- tem as a hierarchy of layers, each one constructed upon the one below it. The first system constructed in this way was the THE system built at the Technische Hoge- school Eindhoven in the Netherlands by E. W. Dijkstra (1968) and his students. The THE system was a simple batch system for a Dutch computer, the Electrolog- ica X8, which had 32K of 27-bit words (bits were expensive back then).
The system had six layers, as shown in Fig. 1-25. Layer 0 dealt with allocation of the processor, switching between processes when interrupts occurred or timers expired. Above layer 0, the system consisted of sequential processes, each of which could be programmed without having to worry about the fact that multiple processes were running on a single processor. In other words, layer 0 provided the basic multiprogramming of the CPU.

![figure 1-25]()

Layer 1 did the memory management. It allocated space for processes in main memory and on a 512K word drum used for holding parts of processes (pages) for which there was no room in main memory. Above layer 1, processes did not have to worry about whether they were in memory or on the drum; the layer 1 software took care of making sure pages were brought into memory at the moment they were needed and removed when they were not needed.
Layer 2 handled communication between each process and the operator con- sole (that is, the user). On top of this layer each process effectively had its own op- erator console. Layer 3 took care of managing the I/O devices and buffering the information streams to and from them. Above layer 3 each process could deal with abstract I/O devices with nice properties, instead of real devices with many pecu- liarities. Layer 4 was where the user programs were found. They did not have to worry about process, memory, console, or I/O management. The system operator process was located in layer 5.
A further generalization of the layering concept was present in the MULTICS system. Instead of layers, MULTICS was described as having a series of concentric rings, with the inner ones being more privileged than the outer ones (which is ef- fectively the same thing). When a procedure in an outer ring wanted to call a pro- cedure in an inner ring, it had to make the equivalent of a system call, that is, a TRAP instruction whose parameters were carefully checked for validity before the call was allowed to proceed. Although the entire operating system was part of the address space of each user process in MULTICS, the hardware made it possible to designate individual procedures (memory segments, actually) as protected against reading, writing, or executing.
Whereas the THE layering scheme was really only a design aid, because all the parts of the system were ultimately linked together into a single executable pro- gram, in MULTICS, the ring mechanism was very much present at run time and enforced by the hardware. The advantage of the ring mechanism is that it can easi- ly be extended to structure user subsystems. For example, a professor could write a program to test and grade student programs and run this program in ring n, with the student programs running in ring n + 1 so that they could not change their grades.

<b>1.7.3 Microkernels</b>

With the layered approach, the designers have a choice where to draw the ker- nel-user boundary. Traditionally, all the layers went in the kernel, but that is not necessary. In fact, a strong case can be made for putting as little as possible in ker- nel mode because bugs in the kernel can bring down the system instantly. In con- trast, user processes can be set up to have less power so that a bug there may not be fatal.
Various researchers have repeatedly studied the number of bugs per 1000 lines of code (e.g., Basilli and Perricone, 1984; and Ostrand and Weyuker, 2002). Bug density depends on module size, module age, and more, but a ballpark figure for serious industrial systems is between two and ten bugs per thousand lines of code. This means that a monolithic operating system of five million lines of code is like- ly to contain between 10,000 and 50,000 kernel bugs. Not all of these are fatal, of course, since some bugs may be things like issuing an incorrect error message in a situation that rarely occurs. Nevertheless, operating systems are sufficiently buggy that computer manufacturers put reset buttons on them (often on the front panel), something the manufacturers of TV sets, stereos, and cars do not do, despite the large amount of software in these devices.
The basic idea behind the microkernel design is to achieve high reliability by splitting the operating system up into small, well-defined modules, only one of which—the microkernel—runs in kernel mode and the rest run as relatively power- less ordinary user processes. In particular, by running each device driver and file system as a separate user process, a bug in one of these can crash that component, but cannot crash the entire system. Thus a bug in the audio driver will cause the sound to be garbled or stop, but will not crash the computer. In contrast, in a monolithic system with all the drivers in the kernel, a buggy audio driver can easily reference an invalid memory address and bring the system to a grinding halt in- stantly.
Many microkernels have been implemented and deployed for decades (Haertig et al., 1997; Heiser et al., 2006; Herder et al., 2006; Hildebrand, 1992; Kirsch et al., 2005; Liedtke, 1993, 1995, 1996; Pike et al., 1992; and Zuberi et al., 1999). With the exception of OS X, which is based on the Mach microkernel (Accetta et al., 1986), common desktop operating systems do not use microkernels. However, they are dominant in real-time, industrial, avionics, and military applications that are mission critical and have very high reliability requirements. A few of the bet- ter-known microkernels include Integrity, K42, L4, PikeOS, QNX, Symbian, and MINIX 3. We now give a brief overview of MINIX 3, which has taken the idea of modularity to the limit, breaking most of the operating system up into a number of independent user-mode processes. MINIX 3 is a POSIX-conformant, open source system freely available at www.minix3.org (Giuffrida et al., 2012; Giuffrida et al., 2013; Herder et al., 2006; Herder et al., 2009; and Hruby et al., 2013).
The MINIX 3 microkernel is only about 12,000 lines of C and some 1400 lines of assembler for very low-level functions such as catching interrupts and switching processes. The C code manages and schedules processes, handles interprocess communication (by passing messages between processes), and offers a set of about 40 kernel calls to allow the rest of the operating system to do its work. These calls perform functions like hooking handlers to interrupts, moving data between ad- dress spaces, and installing memory maps for new processes. The process structure of MINIX 3 is shown in Fig. 1-26, with the kernel call handlers labeled Sys. The device driver for the clock is also in the kernel because the scheduler interacts closely with it. The other device drivers run as separate user processes.
Outside the kernel, the system is structured as three layers of processes all run- ning in user mode. The lowest layer contains the device drivers. Since they run in user mode, they do not have physical access to the I/O port space and cannot issue I/O commands directly. Instead, to program an I/O device, the driver builds a struc- ture telling which values to write to which I/O ports and makes a kernel call telling

![figure 1-26]()

the kernel to do the write. This approach means that the kernel can check to see that the driver is writing (or reading) from I/O it is authorized to use. Consequently (and unlike a monolithic design), a buggy audio driver cannot accidentally write on the disk.
Above the drivers is another user-mode layer containing the servers, which do most of the work of the operating system. One or more file servers manage the file system(s), the process manager creates, destroys, and manages processes, and so on. User programs obtain operating system services by sending short messages to the servers asking for the POSIX system calls. For example, a process needing to do a read sends a message to one of the file servers telling it what to read.
One interesting server is the <b>reincarnation server</b>, whose job is to check if the other servers and drivers are functioning correctly. In the event that a faulty one is detected, it is automatically replaced without any user intervention. In this way, the system is self healing and can achieve high reliability.
The system has many restrictions limiting the power of each process. As men- tioned, drivers can touch only authorized I/O ports, but access to kernel calls is also controlled on a per-process basis, as is the ability to send messages to other proc- esses. Processes can also grant limited permission for other processes to have the kernel access their address spaces. As an example, a file system can grant permis- sion for the disk driver to let the kernel put a newly read-in disk block at a specific address within the file system’s address space. The sum total of all these restric- tions is that each driver and server has exactly the power to do its work and nothing more, thus greatly limiting the damage a buggy component can do.
An idea somewhat related to having a minimal kernel is to put the <b>mechanism</b> for doing something in the kernel but not the <b>policy</b>. To make this point better, consider the scheduling of processes. A relatively simple scheduling algorithm is to assign a numerical priority to every process and then have the kernel run the highest-priority process that is runnable. The mechanism—in the kernel—is to look for the highest-priority process and run it. The policy—assigning priorities to processes—can be done by user-mode processes. In this way, policy and mechan- ism can be decoupled and the kernel can be made smaller.

<b>1.7.4 Client-Server Model</b>

A slight variation of the microkernel idea is to distinguish two classes of proc- esses, the servers, each of which provides some service, and the clients, which use these services. This model is known as the client-server model. Often the lowest layer is a microkernel, but that is not required. The essence is the presence of cli- ent processes and server processes.
Communication between clients and servers is often by message passing. To obtain a service, a client process constructs a message saying what it wants and sends it to the appropriate service. The service then does the work and sends back the answer. If the client and server happen to run on the same machine, certain optimizations are possible, but conceptually, we are still talking about message passing here.
An obvious generalization of this idea is to have the clients and servers run on different computers, connected by a local or wide-area network, as depicted in Fig. 1-27. Since clients communicate with servers by sending messages, the cli- ents need not know whether the messages are handled locally on their own ma- chines, or whether they are sent across a network to servers on a remote machine. As far as the client is concerned, the same thing happens in both cases: requests are sent and replies come back. Thus the client-server model is an abstraction that can be used for a single machine or for a network of machines. 

![figure 1-27]()

Increasingly many systems involve users at their home PCs as clients and large machines elsewhere running as servers. In fact, much of the Web operates this way. A PC sends a request for a Web page to the server and the Web page comes back. This is a typical use of the client-server model in a network.

<b>1.7.5 Virtual Machines</b>

The initial releases of OS/360 were strictly batch systems. Nevertheless, many 360 users wanted to be able to work interactively at a terminal, so various groups, both inside and outside IBM, decided to write timesharing systems for it. The of- ficial IBM timesharing system, TSS/360, was delivered late, and when it finally ar- rived it was so big and slow that few sites converted to it. It was eventually aban- doned after its development had consumed some $50 million (Graham, 1970). But a group at IBM’s Scientific Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, produced a radi- cally different system that IBM eventually accepted as a product. A linear descen- dant of it, called <b>z/VM</b>, is now widely used on IBM’s current mainframes, the zSeries, which are heavily used in large corporate data centers, for example, as e-commerce servers that handle hundreds or thousands of transactions per second and use databases whose sizes run to millions of gigabytes.

<b>VM/370</b>


This system, originally called CP/CMS and later renamed VM/370 (Seawright and MacKinnon, 1979), was based on an astute observation: a timesharing system provides (1) multiprogramming and (2) an extended machine with a more con- venient interface than the bare hardware. The essence of VM/370 is to completely separate these two functions.
The heart of the system, known as the <b>virtual machine monitor</b>, runs on the bare hardware and does the multiprogramming, providing not one, but several vir- tual machines to the next layer up, as shown in Fig. 1-28. However, unlike all other operating systems, these virtual machines are not extended machines, with files and other nice features. Instead, they are exact copies of the bare hardware, in- cluding kernel/user mode, I/O, interrupts, and everything else the real machine has.

![figure 1-28]()


Because each virtual machine is identical to the true hardware, each one can run any operating system that will run directly on the bare hardware. Different vir- tual machines can, and frequently do, run different operating systems. On the orig- inal IBM VM/370 system, some ran OS/360 or one of the other large batch or transaction-processing operating systems, while others ran a single-user, interactive system called <b>CMS</b> (<b>Conversational Monitor System</b>) for interactive timesharing users. The latter was popular with programmers.
When a CMS program executed a system call, the call was trapped to the oper- ating system in its own virtual machine, not to VM/370, just as it would be were it running on a real machine instead of a virtual one. CMS then issued the normal hardware I/O instructions for reading its virtual disk or whatever was needed to carry out the call. These I/O instructions were trapped by VM/370, which then per- formed them as part of its simulation of the real hardware. By completely separat- ing the functions of multiprogramming and providing an extended machine, each of the pieces could be much simpler, more flexible, and much easier to maintain.
In its modern incarnation, z/VM is usually used to run multiple complete oper- ating systems rather than stripped-down single-user systems like CMS. For ex- ample, the zSeries is capable of running one or more Linux virtual machines along with traditional IBM operating systems.
Virtual Machines Rediscovered
While IBM has had a virtual-machine product available for four decades, and a few other companies, including Oracle and Hewlett-Packard, have recently added virtual-machine support to their high-end enterprise servers, the idea of virtu- alization has largely been ignored in the PC world until recently. But in the past few years, a combination of new needs, new software, and new technologies have combined to make it a hot topic.
First the needs. Many companies have traditionally run their mail servers, Web servers, FTP servers, and other servers on separate computers, sometimes with dif- ferent operating systems. They see virtualization as a way to run them all on the same machine without having a crash of one server bring down the rest.
Virtualization is also popular in the Web hosting world. Without virtualization, Web hosting customers are forced to choose between <b>shared hosting</b> (which just gives them a login account on a Web server, but no control over the server soft- ware) and dedicated hosting (which gives them their own machine, which is very flexible but not cost effective for small to medium Websites). When a Web hosting company offers virtual machines for rent, a single physical machine can run many virtual machines, each of which appears to be a complete machine. Customers who rent a virtual machine can run whatever operating system and software they want to, but at a fraction of the cost of a dedicated server (because the same physical machine supports many virtual machines at the same time).
Another use of virtualization is for end users who want to be able to run two or more operating systems at the same time, say Windows and Linux, because some of their favorite application packages run on one and some run on the other. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 1-29(a), where the term ‘‘virtual machine monitor’’ has been renamed <b>type 1 hypervisor</b>, which is commonly used nowadays because ‘‘virtual machine monitor’’ requires more keystrokes than people are prepared to
put up with now. Note that many authors use the terms interchangeably though.

![figure 1-29]()

While no one disputes the attractiveness of virtual machines today, the problem then was implementation. In order to run virtual machine software on a computer, its CPU must be virtualizable (Popek and Goldberg, 1974). In a nutshell, here is the problem. When an operating system running on a virtual machine (in user mode) executes a privileged instruction, such as modifying the PSW or doing I/O, it is essential that the hardware trap to the virtual-machine monitor so the instruc- tion can be emulated in software. On some CPUs—notably the Pentium, its prede- cessors, and its clones—attempts to execute privileged instructions in user mode are just ignored. This property made it impossible to have virtual machines on this hardware, which explains the lack of interest in the x86 world. Of course, there were interpreters for the Pentium, such as Bochs, that ran on the Pentium, but with a performance loss of one to two orders of magnitude, they were not useful for ser- ious work.
This situation changed as a result of several academic research projects in the 1990s and early years of this millennium, notably Disco at Stanford (Bugnion et al., 1997) and Xen at Cambridge University (Barham et al., 2003). These research papers led to several commercial products (e.g., VMware Workstation and Xen) and a revival of interest in virtual machines. Besides VMware and Xen, popular hypervisors today include KVM (for the Linux kernel), VirtualBox (by Oracle), and Hyper-V (by Microsoft).
Some of these early research projects improved the performance over inter- preters like Bochs by translating blocks of code on the fly, storing them in an internal cache, and then reusing them if they were executed again. This improved the performance considerably, and led to what we will call <b>machine simulators</b>, as shown in Fig. 1-29(b). However, although this technique, known as <b>binary translation</b>, helped improve matters, the resulting systems, while good enough to pub- lish papers about in academic conferences, were still not fast enough to use in commercial environments where performance matters a lot.
The next step in improving performance was to add a kernel module to do some of the heavy lifting, as shown in Fig. 1-29(c). In practice now, all commer- cially available hypervisors, such as VMware Workstation, use this hybrid strategy (and have many other improvements as well). They are called type 2 hypervisors by everyone, so we will (somewhat grudgingly) go along and use this name in the rest of this book, even though we would prefer to called them type 1.7 hypervisors to reflect the fact that they are not entirely user-mode programs. In Chap. 7, we will describe in detail how VMware Workstation works and what the various pieces do.
In practice, the real distinction between a type 1 hypervisor and a type 2 hyper- visor is that a type 2 makes uses of a host operating system and its file system to create processes, store files, and so on. A type 1 hypervisor has no underlying sup- port and must perform all these functions itself.
After a type 2 hypervisor is started, it reads the installation CD-ROM (or CD- ROM image file) for the chosen guest operating system and installs the guest OS on a virtual disk, which is just a big file in the host operating system’s file system. Type 1 hypervisors cannot do this because there is no host operating system to store files on. They must manage their own storage on a raw disk partition.
When the guest operating system is booted, it does the same thing it does on the actual hardware, typically starting up some background processes and then a GUI. To the user, the guest operating system behaves the same way it does when running on the bare metal even though that is not the case here.
A different approach to handling control instructions is to modify the operating system to remove them. This approach is not true virtualization, but paravirtual- ization. We will discuss virtualization in more detail in Chap. 7.

<b>The Java Virtual Machine</b>

Another area where virtual machines are used, but in a somewhat different way, is for running Java programs. When Sun Microsystems invented the Java pro- gramming language, it also invented a virtual machine (i.e., a computer architec- ture) called the <b>JVM</b> (<b>Java Virtual Machine</b>). The Java compiler produces code for JVM, which then typically is executed by a software JVM interpreter. The ad- vantage of this approach is that the JVM code can be shipped over the Internet to any computer that has a JVM interpreter and run there. If the compiler had pro- duced SPARC or x86 binary programs, for example, they could not have been shipped and run anywhere as easily. (Of course, Sun could have produced a com- piler that produced SPARC binaries and then distributed a SPARC interpreter, but JVM is a much simpler architecture to interpret.) Another advantage of using JVM is that if the interpreter is implemented properly, which is not completely trivial, incoming JVM programs can be checked for safety and then executed in a protect- ed environment so they cannot steal data or do any damage.

<b>1.7.6 Exokernels</b>

Rather than cloning the actual machine, as is done with virtual machines, an- other strategy is partitioning it, in other words, giving each user a subset of the re- sources. Thus one virtual machine might get disk blocks 0 to 1023, the next one might get blocks 1024 to 2047, and so on.
At the bottom layer, running in kernel mode, is a program called the exokernel (Engler et al., 1995). Its job is to allocate resources to virtual machines and then check attempts to use them to make sure no machine is trying to use somebody else’s resources. Each user-level virtual machine can run its own operating system, as on VM/370 and the Pentium virtual 8086s, except that each one is restricted to using only the resources it has asked for and been allocated.
The advantage of the exokernel scheme is that it saves a layer of mapping. In the other designs, each virtual machine thinks it has its own disk, with blocks run- ning from 0 to some maximum, so the virtual machine monitor must maintain tables to remap disk addresses (and all other resources). With the exokernel, this remapping is not needed. The exokernel need only keep track of which virtual ma- chine has been assigned which resource. This method still has the advantage of separating the multiprogramming (in the exokernel) from the user operating system code (in user space), but with less overhead, since all the exokernel has to do is keep the virtual machines out of each other’s hair.

<h2>1.8 THE WORLD ACCORDING TO C</h2>

Operating systems are normally large C (or sometimes C++) programs consist- ing of many pieces written by many programmers. The environment used for developing operating systems is very different from what individuals (such as stu- dents) are used to when writing small Java programs. This section is an attempt to give a very brief introduction to the world of writing an operating system for small- time Java or Python programmers.

<b>1.8.1 The C Language</b>

This is not a guide to C, but a short summary of some of the key differences between C and languages like <b>Python</b> and especially Java. Java is based on C, so there are many similarities between the two. Python is somewhat different, but still fairly similar. For convenience, we focus on Java. Java, Python, and C are all imperative languages with data types, variables, and control statements, for ex- ample. The primitive data types in C are integers (including short and long ones), characters, and floating-point numbers. Composite data types can be constructed using arrays, structures, and unions. The control statements in C are similar to those in Java, including if, switch, for, and while statements. Functions and param- eters are roughly the same in both languages.
One feature C has that Java and Python do not is explicit pointers. A <b>pointer</b> is a variable that points to (i.e., contains the address of) a variable or data structure. Consider the statements

char c1, c2, *p; 
c1 = ’c’;
p = & c1;
c2 = *p;

which declare c1 and c2 to be character variables and p to be a variable that points to (i.e., contains the address of) a character. The first assignment stores the ASCII code for the character ‘‘c’’ in the variable c1. The second one assigns the address of c1 to the pointer variable p. The third one assigns the contents of the variable pointed to by p to the variable c2, so after these statements are executed, c2 also contains the ASCII code for ‘‘c’’. In theory, pointers are typed, so you are not sup- posed to assign the address of a floating-point number to a character pointer, but in practice compilers accept such assignments, albeit sometimes with a warning. Pointers are a very powerful construct, but also a great source of errors when used carelessly.
Some things that C does not have include built-in strings, threads, packages, classes, objects, type safety, and garbage collection. The last one is a show stopper for operating systems. All storage in C is either static or explicitly allocated and released by the programmer, usually with the library functions malloc and free. It is the latter property—total programmer control over memory—along with explicit pointers that makes C attractive for writing operating systems. Operating systems are basically real-time systems to some extent, even general-purpose ones. When an interrupt occurs, the operating system may have only a few microseconds to perform some action or lose critical information. Having the garbage collector kick in at an arbitrary moment is intolerable.

<b>1.8.2 Header Files</b>

An operating system project generally consists of some number of directories, each containing many .c files containing the code for some part of the system, along with some .h header files that contain declarations and definitions used by one or more code files. Header files can also include simple <b>macros</b>, such as

#define BUFFER SIZE 4096

which allows the programmer to name constants, so that when <i>BUFFER_SIZE</i> is used in the code, it is replaced during compilation by the number 4096. Good C programming practice is to name every constant except 0, 1, and −1, and some- times even them. Macros can have parameters, such as

#define max(a, b) (a > b ? a : b)

which allows the programmer to write

i = max(j, k+1)

and get

i = (j > k+1 ? j : k+1)

to store the larger of j and k+1 in i. Headers can also contain conditional compila- tion, for example

#ifdef X86 
intel int ack(); 
#endif

which compiles into a call to the function intel int ack if the macro X86 is defined and nothing otherwise. Conditional compilation is heavily used to isolate architec- ture-dependent code so that certain code is inserted only when the system is com- piled on the X86, other code is inserted only when the system is compiled on a SPARC, and so on. A .c file can bodily include zero or more header files using the #include directive. There are also many header files that are common to nearly every .c and are stored in a central directory.

<b>1.8.3 Large Programming Projects</b>
To build the operating system, each .c is compiled into an <b>object file</b> by the C compiler. Object files, which have the suffix .o, contain binary instructions for the target machine. They will later be directly executed by the CPU. There is nothing like Java byte code or Python byte code in the C world.
The first pass of the C compiler is called the <b>C preprocessor</b>. As it reads each .c file, every time it hits a #include directive, it goes and gets the header file named in it and processes it, expanding macros, handling conditional compilation (and certain other things) and passing the results to the next pass of the compiler as if they were physically included.
Since operating systems are very large (five million lines of code is not unusual), having to recompile the entire thing every time one file is changed would be unbearable. On the other hand, changing a key header file that is included in thousands of other files does require recompiling those files. Keeping track of which object files depend on which header files is completely unmanageable with- out help.
Fortunately, computers are very good at precisely this sort of thing. On UNIX systems, there is a program called make (with numerous variants such as gmake, pmake, etc.) that reads the Makefile, which tells it which files are dependent on which other files. What make does is see which object files are needed to build the operating system binary and for each one, check to see if any of the files it depends on (the code and headers) have been modified subsequent to the last time the ob- ject file was created. If so, that object file has to be recompiled. When make has determined which .c files have to recompiled, it then invokes the C compiler to recompile them, thus reducing the number of compilations to the bare minimum. In large projects, creating the Makefile is error prone, so there are tools that do it automatically.
Once all the .o files are ready, they are passed to a program called the linker to combine all of them into a single executable binary file. Any library functions cal- led are also included at this point, interfunction references are resolved, and ma- chine addresses are relocated as need be. When the linker is finished, the result is an executable program, traditionally called a.out on UNIX systems. The various components of this process are illustrated in Fig. 1-30 for a program with three C files and two header files. Although we have been discussing operating system de- velopment here, all of this applies to developing any large program.

![figure 1-30]()

<b>1.8.4 The Model of Run Time</b>

Once the operating system binary has been linked, the computer can be rebooted and the new operating system started. Once running, it may dynamically load pieces that were not statically included in the binary such as device drivers and file systems. At run time the operating system may consist of multiple seg- ments, for the text (the program code), the data, and the stack. The text segment is normally immutable, not changing during execution. The data segment starts out at a certain size and initialized with certain values, but it can change and grow as need be. The stack is initially empty but grows and shrinks as functions are called and returned from. Often the text segment is placed near the bottom of memory, the data segment just above it, with the ability to grow upward, and the stack seg- ment at a high virtual address, with the ability to grow downward, but different systems work differently.
In all cases, the operating system code is directly executed by the hardware, with no interpreter and no just-in-time compilation, as is normal with Java.</p>
